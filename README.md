# Fon Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

## Motivation
This is based on our work on automatic speech recognition models for Igbo and Fon. This study led to a paper, [OkwuGbé: End-to-End Speech Recognition for Fon and Igbo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07762), accepted at the AfricaNLP workshop of EACL 2021.

OkwuGbé is a step towards building speech recognition systems for African low-resourced languages. Using Fon and Igbo as our case study, we conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of each language and describe the creation of end-to-end, deep neural network-based speech recognition models for both languages.

## Experiments
Here is the open-source code for the End2End Automatic Speech Recognition Model and data preprocessing steps for Fon language.</br>
The Igbo implementation [here](https://github.com/chrisemezue/IgboASR) and for the full model architecture, see [here](https://github.com/bonaventuredossou/fonasr/blob/main/model_notebook/Okwugbe%20model.pdf)</br>
